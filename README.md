# Prediction-report-on-US-Accident
Couresa class project on report model




1 Introduction
1.1 Background
In recent years, road accidents have become a universal problem and are
considered a significant cause of accidents. Road accidents put enormous impact
on the economy of a country, public, society and environment. It is totally
inappropriate and disheartening to see the people dying from road accidents.
Almost every day, thousands of people lost their lives due to road accidents. It is
observed that residential and shopping areas are riskier than less populated areas
just because of higher exposure. Reducing the chance of road accidents is a very
dominating and challenging topic of research. For handling this stagger issue, deep
analysis of accident dataset is required. Accurate, huge and clean dataset of
accidents is the basis of our prediction. Here we use some machine learning and
deep learning models for analysis and prediction of road accidents. We also find
out the relationship and effect of different variables on the occurrence of road
accidents.
1.2 Problem
The overall problem is to control the road accidents, for which it is needed to find
the severity of an accident. Data that might contribute to predict Severity of 
4
accident include ID, Source, TMC, Start_Time, End_Time, Start_Lat, Start_Lng,
End_Lat, End_Lng, Distance(mi), Description, Number, Street, Side, City, County,
State, Zipcode, Country, Timezone,
Airport_Code,Weather_Timestamp,Temperature(F),Wind_Chill(F),Humidity(%),Pr
essure(in),Visibility(mi),Wind_Direction,Wind_Speed(mph),Precipitation(in),Weat
her_Condition,Amenity,Bump,Crossing,Give_Way,Junction,No_Exit,Astronomical_
Twilight,Traffic_Calming,Traffic_Signal,Civil_Twilight,Sunrise_Sunset,Nautical_Twil
ight, Stop, Station and predict Severity that show least and significant impact on
traffic.
1.3 Interest
Almost every country is interested in predicting the severity of accidents for
controlling the emergency. Accidents have a massive impact on the country's
economy because there is an immense cost to fatalities and injuries. Crashes
amount to approximately 1% GDP; in middle-income countries the cost is 1.5% of 
the GDP; and in high-income countries the cost is 2 percent of the GDP.
